# WellBe - A Health Prediction App

A mini project for SBJITMR.

## Project Details

An android application “WellBe – A Health Prediction App” which
has a list of number of diseases that predict the risk of heart attack or diabetes. All we need to
do in this app is to add our symptoms the values of the required parameter and it predicts the
high risk or low risk of the disease using a machine learning model deployed on our servers.

## ML models

WellBe is a Prediction Application using Machine Learning Technique. Heart attack
and Diabetes prediction will be found primarily on real-time processing, distributed and realtime classification and distribution, storage so; databases can be easily modified by the
doctors.

These models are deployed on heroku servers.
